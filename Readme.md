## Note Synthesis

This project explores the various uses of gaussian processes in signal processing and random walk generation. See the [writeup](Gaussian Processes Writeup.pdf) for more detail. 

#### Parsing Beran's Cadenza

See [`note_synthesis.m`](code/note_synthesis.m) for code which takes a 5 second [audio file](fivesec.au) and finds the most likely sequence of notes. 

#### Lacunary Series

See [`lacunary_series.m`](code/lacunary_series.m) for an exploration of the differentiability of Lacunary Series. 

#### Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes

See [`ornstein_uhlenbeck_processes.m`](code/ornstein_uhlenbeck_processes.m) for a comparison between Brownian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
